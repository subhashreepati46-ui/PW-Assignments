    "\n",
    "How Boosting Works\n",
    "Boosting trains models one after another, where each subsequent model focuses on correcting the errors of previous ones by assigning higher weights to misclassified training samples. The final prediction is a weighted combination of all weak learners, with better-performing models given more influence.\n",
    "​\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Improvement Mechanism\n",
    "\n",
    "* Step 1: Start with equal weights for all training samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Step 2: Train first weak learner (typically shallow decision tree).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Step 3: Increase weights of misclassified samples, decrease correctly classified ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Step 4: Train next weak learner on reweighted data, repeat iteratively.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Result: Converts high-bias weak learners into low-bias, high-accuracy strong ensemble."

    "Training Process Differences\n",
    "\n",
    "AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting):\n",
    "\n",
    "* Re-weights training samples: Each iteration assigns higher weights to misclassified samples and lower weights to correctly classified ones, forcing subsequent weak learners (typically decision stumps) to focus on difficult examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Model weights by performance: Stronger classifiers get higher influence in final prediction via weighted voting.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Uses exponential loss: Sensitive to outliers as it exponentially penalizes errors.\n",
    "​\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient Boosting:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Fits residuals (pseudo-residuals): Each new weak learner predicts the negative gradient of the loss function from previous ensemble predictions, not sample weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "* No sample re-weighting: All training samples retain equal importance; focuses on overall loss minimization.\n",

    "Key Efficiency Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordered Target Statistics: Instead of one-hot encoding (which explodes dimensionality for high-cardinality features like customer IDs), CatBoost computes category statistics sequentially during training. Each split uses only previously seen data from prior trees, avoiding target leakage common in mean/target encoding.\n",
    "​\n",
    "\n",
    "No Preprocessing Required: Pass categorical columns directly via cat_features=[col_indices]; CatBoost automatically converts them optimally, unlike XGBoost/LightGBM requiring label/one-hot encoding first.\n",
    "​\n",
    "\n",
    "High-Cardinality Handling: Efficiently manages features with 1000s of unique values (ZIP codes, product SKUs) without sparse matrices, preserving information while reducing memory/compute overhead.\n",
    "​\n",
    "\n",
    "Symmetric Trees + Regularization: Builds identical tree structures across features with built-in overfitting prevention, making categorical splits more stable than traditional gradient boosting.\n",
