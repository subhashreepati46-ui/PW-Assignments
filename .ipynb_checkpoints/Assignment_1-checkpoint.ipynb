Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n","\n","    Lists are mutable because they are designed to be dynamic collections where elements can be added, removed, or changed after creation.\n","    Tuples, on the other hand, are immutable by design.

What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n","\n","    The difference lies in how the conversion happens:\n","    Implicit type casting (or coercion) is done automatically by the Python interpreter, usually to avoid errors. For example,\n","    when adding an integer and a float, Python implicitly converts the integer to a float before performing the addition.\n","    Explicit type casting is done manually by the programmer using\n","    built-in functions like int(), float(), str(), etc.,\n","    to convert a value from one type to another."],"metadata":{"id":"PWqUzXTpq0cW"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["11.
