    "   * Each item is stored as a key:value pair inside curly braces, like {\"name\": \"Amit\", \"age\": 22}.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *  Keys must be unique and immutable (like strings, numbers, or tuples); values can be any type and can be repeated.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Python uses a hash table to place each key-value pair: the key is hashed (converted to a number), and that decides where the pair is stored in memory for fast lookup.\n",

    "   \n",
    "    Tuples ensure data integrity in Python mainly through their immutability—once a tuple is created, its contents cannot be changed, added, or removed anywhere in the program. This immutability guarantees that the data remains consistent and reliable, reducing the risk of bugs caused by unintended modifications. Because tuples cannot be altered, they are thread-safe, avoiding concurrency issues like race conditions in multi-threaded applications. Additionally, tuples being immutable can be used as dictionary keys or set elements due to their stable hash values, which lists cannot do."

    "    A hash table is a data structure that stores data in key-value pairs and uses a hash function to compute an index (or hash code) in an internal array where the value is stored. This allows for very fast data lookup, insertion, and deletion on average in constant time, O(1).\n",

    "\n",
    "    Lists in Python can contain different data types. A single list can hold elements of various types like integers, strings, floats, booleans, other lists, tuples, dictionaries, and more. This flexibility is because Python lists are heterogeneous collections, allowing multiple data types to coexist in one list.\n",
