    "* Infinite Data Growth: Unbounded growth of dictionaries, lists, or other collections can quickly exhaust available system memory, causing crashes or degraded performance.​\n",
    "\n",
    "* Global Variable Retention: Excessive or careless use of global variables can prevent memory from being reclaimed, as they stay referenced throughout the program lifetime.​   \n",
    "\n",
    "* Suboptimal Use of Data Structures: Creating and holding large objects in memory unnecessarily (e.g., using lists instead of generators for iteration) leads to inefficient memory utilization.​\n",

    " Troubleshooting and Prevention Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "* Regular profiling with tools like memory_profiler, tracemalloc, and\n",
    "built-in gc module helps detect and diagnose memory usage issues.​\n",
    "\n",
    "* Breaking reference cycles using weak references (weakref module) assists in letting the garbage collector reclaim unused memory.​\n",
    "\n",
    "* Using context managers (with statements) ensures proper closure and cleanup for files and resources.​\n",

    "Here are the main differences between NumPy arrays and Python lists, explained point-by-point:​\n",
    "\n",
    "*  Data Type Consistency:\n",
    "\n",
    "   NumPy arrays require all elements to be of the same data type (e.g., all integers or all floats), making them predictable and optimized for mathematical operations.​\n",
    "   Python lists can contain elements of any type in the same list (e.g., ints, floats, strings mixed together), which adds flexibility but impacts performance.​\n",
    "\n",
    "* Memory Efficiency and Speed:\n",
    "\n",
    "   NumPy arrays are stored in contiguous memory blocks using a C-based backend, which allows for quick processing and lower memory usage, especially beneficial with large datasets.​\n",
    "   Python lists store references to objects scattered in memory, making them slower for large computations and requiring more memory per element.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Mathematical Operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "  NumPy arrays provide a rich set of efficient mathematical and   statistical functions that perform element-wise operations directly   without loops (e.g., addition, multiplication, square root).​\n",
    "  Python lists do not support element-wise math; you must loop through the   list or use list comprehensions, which is less efficient.​\n",
    "\n",
    "* Dimensionality:\n",
    "\n",
    "  NumPy arrays easily handle multi-dimensional data with built-in support for matrices, tensors (2D, 3D, etc.), which is crucial for numerical and scientific computing.​\n",
    "  Python lists can be nested to represent multi-dimensional structures, but accessing and manipulating data in them is cumbersome and error-prone.​\n",
    "\n",
    "* Flexibility and Use Cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "  NumPy arrays are less flexible—once created, their shape and data type are fixed, but this rigidity results in optimized performance for mathematical and scientific applications.​\n",
    "  Python lists are highly flexible, allowing easy resizing, appending, and changing element types, making them suitable for general-purpose programming and mixed data.​\n",
    "\n",
    "* Best Use:\n",
    "\n",
    "  Use NumPy arrays for data analytics, machine learning, and any task involving large amounts of numbers for speed and efficiency.​\n",
    "  Use Python lists for general programming, storing objects, or when different data types are needed in a single sequence.​\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Each structure fits a different set of needs based on efficiency, flexibility, and type safety."

    "\n",
    "* apply() works on both Series and DataFrames. For Series, it applies functions element-wise, like map(). For DataFrames, it can apply functions across rows or columns using the axis parameter, enabling more complex row-wise, column-wise, or aggregation operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "*  map() does not support an axis parameter and is best suited for straightforward element-wise mappings or substitutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* apply() supports the axis argument to specify whether the function is applied row-wise or column-wise in DataFrames, providing more flexibility for complex transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "* While both can accept functions, map() uniquely accepts dictionaries or Series as mapping inputs, which apply() does not.\n",
